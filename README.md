## 💡 Core Principles

I believe in building software that is:

### 🎯 Simple Data Models
Designing clean, intuitive data structures that are easy to understand, maintain, and scale. Complexity should come from business logic, not data design.

### 📡 Predictable APIs
Creating well-documented, consistent APIs that follow established conventions and make it easy for developers to integrate and build upon. Every endpoint should behave as expected.

### ⚡ Performance-Conscious Code
Writing efficient code that respects resources and user time. Performance optimization isn't an afterthought—it's part of the development process from day one.

### 🛡️ Tests That Protect Behavior
Prioritizing comprehensive testing that ensures code behaves correctly today and tomorrow. Tests should verify behavior, not just coverage metrics. A well-tested codebase is a confident codebase.
